# Newflix project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is Newflix app ?

Newflix is a cinema app built with ReactJS throw the tool create-react-app. Newflix is connected to TMDb API. On this app, we can find all movies & make them fav.
This project is far from perfect. It is one of my first projects in ReactJS connected to an API.
